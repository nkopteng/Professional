# So this is an attempt to check yesterday date to see if it is a non-working day,
# a Saturday or a Sunday, because the interprise does not work on Week-ends. 
# If it fills up those contitions , it returns none, else, it returns Yesterday in the format DDMMYY. 
# As you can see it is based on Cameroonian holidays. The holidays class did not include Cameroon even though
# it had Nigeria, Burundi, and others. My thiny knowledge of Python had me get inspired with Nigeria and Burundi
#to create the Cameroon class. But I cannot get it to work properly. Any comment advice and code proposals are welcome.
